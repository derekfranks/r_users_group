## IBM Watson and R

I've created a copy of my materials for the IBM Watson and R Presentation.

If you don't already have it installed, you'll need to download and install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Unfortunately, I cannot share the .txt files I showed in the session or my API key, but you should be able to substitute in your own txt files and API credentials.

To get an API key go to  [bluemix.net](http://bluemix.net) and sign up for an account (it's free).  Then follow these instructions to get an API key:  [API Key Instructions](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s33/sh/5a46e3e9-0611-4f7e-98c9-7af28a0d89d5/a8b4e75d3ca7c938)

Please feel free to reach out with any questions.
