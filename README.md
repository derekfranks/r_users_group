## IBM Watson and R

I've created a copy of my materials for the March Dallas R Users Group meeting.

Unfortunately, I cannot share the .txt files I showed in the session or my API key, but you should be able to substitute in your own txt files and API credentials.

You can get API keys from [bluemix.net](http://bluemix.net)


Please feel free to reach out with any questions.
